 ## SQL Query for Combining Sales Forecast and Actuals Data

Filename: combine_sales_forecast_and_actuals.sql
Summary: This SQL script combines sales forecast data from the `opportunity_dev.forecast.sales_forecast_by_month` table and actual sales data from the `singularity.rpt.policykm` table. It uses a `UNION ALL` statement to unify the data based on specific columns like date, funeral_home_id, amount, source, and version. Ideal for reporting and analytics where consolidated data view is required.
